#### The Future of Television and Applications: by Ryan Glisson

## Why learn about the future of television and applications?

Television has come a long way since the first electronic television was invented in 1927 by Philo Taylor Farnsworth. These devices were very small compared to the eighty inch displays we see today. Seeing how much it has changed throughout the years can show why it's important to learn what the next twenty years will bring us in the world of televsion, and how difficult it will be to adapt to these changes.

Learning about the future of television becomes more important because of the constant changes that happens to it on a daily basis. We live in a world of technology surrounded by applications such as Netflix, and Hulu that could potentially take over in the years to come. Televisions have been given larger displays over the years along with an increase in graphics giving the viewer a better expereince. I will be telling you what the future will hold for television and how to navigate the changes that will become our new world.

The target audience is mainly middle-aged adults who don't have the initial knowledge of how to use applications like Netflix, and Hulu. These are the future of television because they have the potential to take over live TV. Younger kids use these applications everyday and can honestly teach others how to use them if they wanted. I want to be able to help the older generationa adapt to them, so they will know how to use them when it becomes their only option.

## What will the future of television look like?

The future of television will continue to transform into a more personal experience for viewers unlike the world has ever seen before. The best way to describe this is the constant growth of streaming and on-demand services provided. This gives the viewer an option to choose exactly what they want to watch, and when they want to watch it. Customers won't have to wait around for their favorite show to start because they can just click play on applications like Netflix whenever they want. 

Popular streaming services today include:

- Netflix
- Hulu
- Disney+
- Amazon prime
- Youtube TV

These services are already being widely used by viewers, and are growing in popularity each day. Each services provides different shows, and viewers can choose which one they prefer based on their interests. For instance, Disney+ will have shows that are more prone to younger users who can watch their favorite movies whenever they want.
